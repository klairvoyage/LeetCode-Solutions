# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. Each problem solution is implemented in a separate file and organized by the problem's number and title. This README file serves as a guide to navigate and understand the structure of this repository.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each LeetCode problem has its own directory named with the problem number and title in the following format: `ProblemNumber_ProblemTitle`.
- Inside each problem directory, you will find the following files:
    - `solution.py`: This file contains the Python implementation of the solution to the problem.
    - `README.md`: This file explains the problem statement, approach, and any additional notes or explanations related to the solution.
    - `testcases.py` (optional): This file includes test cases to validate the solution's correctness.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for your own learning and problem-solving journey. You can browse the directories and open the `README.md` file within each problem folder to understand the problem statement and the approach used to solve it.

To run the code locally, make sure you have Python installed. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the desired solution, and execute the following command:

```shell
python solution.py
```

Please note that you need to have Python installed on your machine to run the test cases.

## Disclaimer
The solutions provided in this repository are my own work and may not always be the most optimal or efficient. They serve as a learning resource and may not reflect the best industry-standard practices. Additionally, LeetCode may have multiple valid solutions for a problem, and my solutions may not cover all possible edge cases. Therefore, use these solutions as a reference and strive to understand the underlying concepts rather than relying solely on them.
